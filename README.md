Mission Learning Statement
- Mission: Provide a reusable template for fast bootstrapping of local agents and data tools.
- Learning focus: repeatable project scaffolding, consistent run/test workflows, and clean handoffs.
- Project start date: 2026-01-12 (inferred from folder timestamp)

Generic project template.

Quickstart:
- CLI: `python run_app.py status`
- GUI: `python run_app.py gui`
